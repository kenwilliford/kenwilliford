### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an astrobiologist and organic geochemist currently working on the Mars 2020 rover mission and growing ever more interested in the potential of artificial intelligence to help solve "wicked" problems relevant to human well-being, especially in climate and the renewable energy transition. My research focus for most of the last 20 years has been the co-evolution of life and environments during times of great change in Earth history. I started working for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2012, where I founded the Astrobiogeochemistry Laboratory (abcLab) to develop methods to look for signs of life in rocks one day returned from Mars. From 2014 through 2021 I served as Deputy Project Scientist on the Mars 2020 rover mission, co-leading the >450 person international science team and negotiating the highest-level design and risk trades at the interface of science and engineering. I was also part of the original proposal team for the Mars 2020 SHERLOC instrument, a deep UV fluorescence and Raman spectrometer and camera system designed to analyze the fine (10 to 100 micrometer)-scale shapes and compositions of Mars rock targets encountered by the rover to seek signs of life and environment. About a year after relocating with my family to Seattle in late 2020, I left JPL and the management job to focus on day-to-day mission science, which I do as a proud member of the non-profit Blue Marble Space Institute for Science. I started learning Python in mid-2022, and my learning accelerated rapidly with the help of ChatGPT and later GPT-4. I spent the second half of 2023 in a MIT course on Data Science and Analytics in order to ground myself further in the fundamentals of predictive models and machine learning, and some of the work from that course will be hosted here. Send me an email at kenwilliford@gmail.com with questions or ideas about how we might work together to make the world better.
